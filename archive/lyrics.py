# Text Format
# Authentication
# Access for Apps Without Users
# If your application doesn't include user-specific behaviors you can use the client access token associated with your API instead of tokens for authenticated users. These tokens are only valid for read-only endpoints that are not restricted by a required scope.

# You can get a client access token by clicking "Generate Access Token" on the API Client management page.

# Genius uses the OAuth2 standard for making API calls on behalf of individual users. Requests are authenticated with an Access Token sent in an HTTP header (or as a request parameter if you must).

# All interaction with the API must be done over HTTPS.

# An example request would look like this:

# https://api.genius.com/oauth/authorize?
# client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
# redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&
# scope=REQUESTED_SCOPE&
# state=SOME_STATE_VALUE&
# response_type=code
# Getting an Access Token
# Start by directing a user of your application to Genius's authentication page at https://api.genius.com/oauth/authorize with the following query parameters:

# client_id: Your application's Client ID, as listed on the API Client management page
# redirect_uri: The URI Genius will redirect the user to after they've authorized your application; it must be the same as the one set for the API client on the management page
# scope: The permissions your application is requesting as a space-separated list (see available scopes below)
# state: A value that will be returned with the code redirect for maintaining arbitrary state through the authorization process
# response_type: Always "code"
# More About State
# One important use for this value is increased security—by including a unique, difficult to guess value (say, a hash of a user session value), potential attackers can be prevented from sending phony redirects to your app.

# On the authentication page the user can choose to allow your application to access Genius on their behalf. They'll be asked to sign in (or, if necessary, create an account) first. Then the user is redirected to https://YOUR_REDIRECT_URI/?code=CODE&state=SOME_STATE_VALUE.

# Your application can exchange the code query parameter from the redirect for an access token by making a POST request to https://api.genius.com/oauth/token with the following request body data:

# {
#   "code": "CODE_FROM_REDIRECT",
#   "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
#   "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
#   "redirect_uri": "YOUR_REDIRECT_URI",
#   "response_type": "code",
#   "grant_type": "authorization_code"
# }
# code: The code query parameter from the redirect to your redirect_uri
# client_secret: Your application's Client Secret, as listed on the API Client management page
# grant_type: Aways "authorization_code"
# client_id: As above
# redirect_uri: As above
# response_type: As above
# Most of these are the same values as used in the initial request.

# {
#   "access_token": "ACCESS_TOKEN"
# }
# The response body will be an object with the token as the value for the access_token key. Save the token and use it to make requests on behalf of the authorizing user.

# Available Scopes
# Access tokens can only be used for resources that are covered by the scopes provided when they created. These are the available scopes and the endpoints they grant permission for:

# Scope	Endpoints
# me	GET /account
# create_annotation	POST /annotations
# manage_annotation	PUT /annotations/:id
# DELETE /annotations/:id
# vote	PUT /annotations/:id/upvote
# PUT /annotations/:id/downvote
# PUT /annotations/:id/unvote
# Using An Access Token
# GET /some-endpoint HTTP/1.1
# User-Agent: CompuServe Classic/1.22
# Accept: application/json
# Host: api.genius.com
# Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
# To make authenticated requests with an access token, include it in an HTTP Authorization header preceded by the word "Bearer" and a space. For example, the value of the header could be Bearer 1234tokentokentoken.

# Passing the token in the authorization header is the preferred way to authenticate API requests. However, the API also supports providing the token as the access_token query parameter of a GET request or element of a POST body.

# Response Format
# GET https://api.genius.com/web_pages/lookup?canonical_url=http://example.com
# {
#   "meta": {
#     "status": 200
#   },
#   "response": {
#     "web_page": {
#       "annotation_count":7,
#       "id": 1480,
#       ...
#     }
#   }
# }
# All Genius API responses are JSON. Every JSON response has a meta field with a status value that is an integer representation of the HTTP status code for the response.

# For successful requests, there is also a top-level response field which will be a nested object. For example, a request for details about annotations on a web page:

# Errors
# GET https://api.genius.com/apples
# {
#   "meta": {
#     "status": 404,
#     "message": "Not found"
#   }
# }
# If a request fails or errors (i.e. the status values is 4xx or 5xx). the meta field will also have a message value that is a string with details about the error. For example, a request to a non-existent API endpoint:

# Text Formatting (text_format option)
# {
#   "plain": "A hilarious word!",
#   "html": "<p>A hilarious word!</p>",
#   "dom": {
#     "tag": "root",
#     "children": [ {
#       "tag": "p",
#       "children": [ "A hilarious word!" ]
#     } ]
#   }
# }
# Many API requests accept a text_format query parameter that can be used to specify how text content is formatted. The value for the parameter must be one or more of plain, html, and dom. The value returned will be an object with key-value pairs of formats and results:

# plain is just plain text, no markup
# html is a string of unescaped HTML suitable for rendering by a browser
# dom is a nested object representing and HTML DOM hierarchy that can be used to programmatically present structured content
